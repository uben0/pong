# KLibrary

KLibrary is a set of modules providing classes and functions to easily create a graphic program like a 2D game.
You can create a window by including "KWindow.hpp" and declaring <code>KWindow my_window_object("window name", 1920, 1080);</code>.<br>
You can manage events by accessing the <code>event</code> attribute  of a <code>KWindow</code><br>
<br>
For instance there are modules for images (<code>KSurface</code>), text (<code>KFont</code> and <code>KText</code>) and network (<code>KSocket</code>).
